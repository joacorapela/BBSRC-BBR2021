List the main objectives of the proposal in order of priority [up to
  4000 chars]

The overall goal of this proposal is to extend, establish, distribute and support Bonsai, a fully integrated software
environment to enable cutting-edge reproducible laboratory systems neuroscience experiments in animal models.

Specifically, we will:

1. Develop, test and deploy a new software pipeline to incorporate external packages into Bonsai's C# environment.

2. Incorporate a suite of machine-learning-driven analysis tools into the Bonsai environment to implement:
2a. video-based  behavioural analysis
2b. real-time interfacing of population-scale activity with laboratory control  
2c. evaluate competing data analytic approaches within a single experimental framework

3. Enhance the quality and reproducibility of systems neuroscience through:
3a. fully open-source and public-facing development
3b. rapid release of, and community engagement around, new tools
3c. provision of standard implementations of analysis and control methods, with the ability to distribute automated
descriptions of analysis pipelines for reproducibility.

4. Extend and support the Bonsai user community through code and forum engagement and development workshops.
