Experimental control and neural data analysis are currently highly
disassociated.  Most neuroscientists collect their data and only afterward
analyse it. This split has had dramatic consequences for the progress of
neuroscience. First, most experimental control methods currently do not use
advanced data analysis methods to enhance their functionality. Second, the vast
majority of neural data analysis methods are offline and do not provide key
functionality needed for online experimental control. Using advanced data
analysis methods in experimental control will improve the sophistication of
experiments that are currently possible, and generate new demands for neural
data analysis methods that will trigger advances in machine learning.

A central goal of the software resource proposed here is to address this
problem, by providing Bonsai~(an experimental control software ecosystem;
Figure~\ref{fig:bonsai} and Section~\ref{sec:bonsai}) with state-of-the-art
online (and offline) data analysis methods
(Figure~\ref{fig:proposedBonsaiExtensions} and
Section~\ref{sec:functionality}). Bonsai is
\textbf{unique} among experimental control software in that it allows people
with no programming experience to control sophisticated experiments. Its large
and rapidly growing user base demonstrates the need for this type of software
resources. With the proposed functionality to be added to Bonsai, its users
will be able to use sophisticated machine-learning methods to control their
experiments and analyse their data. This
\textbf{democratisation} of machine learning
functionality will allow scientists without computational skills to control
sophisticated experiments and analyse their data in unprecedented ways, which
will most probably yield important \textbf{advances in science}.

Currently Bonsai has its own package manager, and its community of users have
already extended Bonsai's functionality with several contributed packages
(e.g., \ldots \textcolor{red}{Goncalo please reference the best contributed
packages developed by the Bonsai user community}). However, these packages need to
be written in C\#, while most current neuroscience data analysis methods are
written in Python, R or Matlab. We propose to add to Bonsai capabilities to
communicate with software written in these languages
(Section~\ref{sec:softwareInfrastructure}).  These capabilities will allow a
large number of neuroscience data analysis methods to be easily integrated into
the Bonsai ecosystem and will provide Bonsai users a large repertoire of
advanced machine learning methods for their behavioural and neural data
analysis.
%
Using these capabilities we will integrate into Bonsai an initial set of
state-of-the art behavioural and neural data analysis methods
(Section~\ref{sec:functionality}).

Developers of advanced data-analysis methods should become interested in
integrating them into the Bonsai ecosystem, as it will allow their methods to
reach the wide Bonsai user community. In addition this integration will enable
method developers to easily compare the performance of their methods with
that of many methods previously integrated into the Bonsai ecosystem. Method
developers will thus become a new type of Bonsai users, which will contribute
to the \textbf{sustainability} of the proposed resource beyond the period of
BBSRC-BBR funding.

Bonsai is an excellent tool for reproducible data acquisition and
experimental control. For example, an experiment implemented in Bonsai can be replicated in
a new laboratory by just sharing a Bonsai configuration file. With the addition
of the proposed machine learning functionality Bonsai will extend this
reproducibility to the domain of data analysis
(Section~\ref{sec:reproducibility}).
